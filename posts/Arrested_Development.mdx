# There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor.

Really? Did nothing cancel? I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.

We just call it a sausage. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. __Army had half a day.__ *Well, what do you expect, mother?* I care deeply for nature.

## Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun.

There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. Army had half a day. I've opened a door here that I regret. That's why you always leave a note!

1. I'm half machine. I'm a monster.
2. Marry me.
3. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right.

### Not tricks, Michael, illusions.

Whoa, this guy's straight? I'm afraid I just blue myself. I've opened a door here that I regret. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Guy's a pro.

* He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.

Guy's a pro. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Guy's a pro. I care deeply for nature. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.

We just call it a sausage. That's why you always leave a note! It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Across from where? Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast.

That's why you always leave a note! No… but I'd like to be asked! No… but I'd like to be asked! First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. I'm a monster.

No… but I'd like to be asked! No… but I'd like to be asked! No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. I'm afraid I just blue myself.

It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' I'm afraid I just blue myself.

What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Steve Holt! Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life.

But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? Well, what do you expect, mother? I've opened a door here that I regret. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor.

As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.

# I am not a killer.

Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. This man is a knight in shining armor. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!

Makes me a … scientist. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. __Boo.__ *Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss.* After all, you are a client.

## Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! You're a killer. I catch killers.

1. I'm partial to air conditioning.
2. You all right, Dexter?
3. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.

### I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.

I'm really more an apartment person. I like seafood. You look…perfect. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. You're a killer. I catch killers.

I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. God created pudding, and then he rested. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm really more an apartment person. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm really more an apartment person. Tell him time is of the essence. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Tell him time is of the essence. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm really more an apartment person.

Watching ice melt. This is fun. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

I'm really more an apartment person. Keep your mind limber. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.

Hello, Dexter Morgan. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

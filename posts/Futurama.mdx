# Hey, whatcha watching?

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. When will that be? __Daddy Bender, we're hungry.__ *No!* The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!

## I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Daylight and everything. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

1. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!
2. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
3. You're going to do his laundry?

### Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.

For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Ow, my spirit! I wish! It's a nickel.

* Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!
* No! Don't jump!
* I had more, but you go ahead.

Your best is an idiot! Can I use the gun? Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? They're like sex, except I'm having them!

For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Oh sure! Blame the wizards!

Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!

Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Take me to your leader! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Bender, we're trying our best. Who are those horrible orange men? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?

I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Oh sure! Blame the wizards! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!

With gusto. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Noooooo! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.

Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! And until then, I can never die? You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.
